# Project Description
This project involved conducting an in-depth analysis of hotel booking data using Power BI. SQL Server was used to build a database, clean the data, and perform initial analysis. The cleaned data was then utilized to create a Power BI dashboard to discover trends and answer business-relevant questions. The main goals were to analyze trends in hotel revenue over a three-year period, assess the utilization of parking spaces, and provide insights into whether the hotel should consider expanding its parking lot.

 Key Questions:

* Is our hotel revenue growing year by year?
* Should we increase the size of our parking lot?
* What trends can be identified in the data?

Data Overview:
The analysis spans from January 2018 to September 2020, covering two types of hotels: City Hotels and Resort Hotels. Key metrics include revenue, average daily rate (ADR), total nights booked, discount rates, and the number of required parking spaces.

Findings Summary:

* Revenue Growth: The total revenue over the period amounts to $29.12 million, with significant growth observed in 2019. However, there was a decline in 2020, potentially due to external factors such as market changes or global events.
* Parking Lot Utilization: Across the three years, a total of 8,692 parking spaces were required, with an overall parking utilization rate of 8.63%. The data suggests a slight decline in the parking percentage over time.
* Revenue by Hotel Type: City Hotels and Resort Hotels contributed almost equally to the revenue, with Resort Hotels slightly leading at 51.68%.

Conclusion:

The analysis reveals fluctuating revenue trends, with a peak in 2019 followed by a decline. The current parking utilization suggests that expanding the parking lot may not be necessary unless future trends indicate otherwise.
